**From Soil to Sanctuary — Building the Future of Food**

EatoSystems is the world’s first fully integrated, open-source architecture for regenerative food systems — spanning AI-powered agriculture, regenerative finance, logistics, governance, and global food security. Designed for humanity, powered by community.

## 🔭 Our Mission

To regenerate Earth’s food systems by transforming how food is **produced, moved, financed, and governed** — guided by the values of **health, community**, and **environmental stewardship**.

## 🌍 What We're Building

EatoSystems is built on 12 interconnected systems, each representing a vital layer of our regenerative future:
