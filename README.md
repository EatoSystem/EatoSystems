**From Soil to Sanctuary — Building the Future of Food**

EatoSystems is the world’s first fully integrated ecosystem of regenerative food systems — spanning AI-powered agriculture, financial indexes for regenerative capital, decentralized infrastructure, and open-source tools for national and global food sovereignty.

## 🔭 Our Mission

To transform how food is produced, moved, financed, and governed — by building an open, regenerative operating system for Earth.

## 🌍 What We're Building

EatoSystems is a living architecture built on 12 interconnected systems:

| System | Description | Hackathon Location & Date |
|--------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **SOIL** | Cultural & knowledge foundation | Copenhagen · Sept 2025 |
| **SEED** | Modular AI agents (EatoAgent) | Berlin · Oct 2025 |
| **POLLINATION** | Regenerative food index (EatoIndex) | New York · Nov 2025 |
| **ROOT** | Digital twin infrastructure (EatoVerse) | Dubai · Dec 2025 |
| **SPROUT** | Regenerative robotics (EatoBotics) | Tokyo · Jan 2026 |
| **FLOW** | Clean food logistics (EatoTransit) | Detroit · Feb 2026 |
| **MYCELIUM** | Distributed AI coordination (EatoAI) | Paris · Mar 2026 |
| **CROP** | Regenerative capital engine (EatoFund) | London · Apr 2026 |
| **HARVEST** | National food system rollout (EatoSystem) | Amsterdam · May 2026 |
| **REGENERATION** | Food governance infrastructure (EatoGov) | Singapore · Jun 2026 |
| **CANOPY** | Global food security system (EatoSecure) | Rome · Jul 2026 |
| **SANCTUARY** | Global trust & integrity (EatoFoundation) | Geneva · Sept 2026 |
