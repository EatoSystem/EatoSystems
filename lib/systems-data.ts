      It is the SOIL of EatoSystems — where every system begins with a story, a skill, or a spark of intention.
      
      EatoGlobal brings together human knowledge — collecting and preserving the food stories, practices, and traditions that define our relationship with food across cultures and generations. It empowers open collaboration — enabling contributors from around the world to co-create sustainable food solutions through storytelling, design, technology, and innovation. And it drives global action — uniting diverse voices to shape national EatoTeams, contribute to open-source development, and support the growth of intelligent, inclusive food systems.
      
      Whether you're a farmer, developer, designer, chef, storyteller, student, or someone passionate about the future of food — EatoGlobal is your place to participate. Your knowledge, your culture, your skills, your story — they all feed the system.`,
